The
federal
government
suspended
sales
of
U.S.
savings
bonds
because
Congress
has
n't
lifted
the
ceiling
on
government
debt
.
Until
Congress
acts
,
the
government
has
n't
any
authority
to
issue
new
debt
obligations
of
any
kind
,
the
Treasury
said
.
The
government
's
borrowing
authority
dropped
at
midnight
Tuesday
to
$
2.80
trillion
from
$
2.87
trillion
.
Legislation
to
lift
the
debt
ceiling
is
ensnarled
in

fight

taxes
.

voted
to
raise
the
ceiling
to
$
3.1
trillion
,
but
the
Senate
is
n't
expected
to
act
until
next
week
at
the
earliest
.
The
Treasury
said
the
U.S.
will
default
on
Nov.
9
if
Congress
does
n't
act
by
then

When
it
's
time
for
their
biannual
powwow
,
the
nation
's
manufacturing
titans
typically
jet
off
to
the
sunny
confines
of
resort
towns
like
Boca
Raton
and
Hot
Springs
.
Not
this
year
.
The
National
Association
of
Manufacturers
settled
on
the
Hoosier
capital
of
Indianapolis
for
its
fall
board
meeting
.
And
the
city
decided
to
treat
its
guests
more
like
royalty
or
rock
stars
than
factory
owners
.
The
idea
,
of
course
:
to
prove
to
125
corporate
decision
makers
that
the
buckle
on
the
Rust
Belt
is
n't
so
rusty
after
all
,
that
it
's
a
good
place
for
a
company
to
expand
.
On
the
receiving
end
of
the
message
were
officials
from
giants
like
Du
Pont
and
Maytag
,
along
with
lesser
knowns
like
Trojan
Steel
and
the
Valley
Queen
Cheese
Factory
.
For
starters
,
the
executives
joined
Mayor
William
H.
Hudnut
III
for
an
evening
of
the
Indianapolis
Symphony
Orchestra
and
a
guest
pianist-comedian
Victor
Borge
.
Champagne
and
dessert
followed
.
The
next
morning
,
with
a
police
escort
,
busloads
of
executives
and
their
wives
raced
to
the
Indianapolis
Motor
Speedway
,
unimpeded
by
traffic
or
red
lights
.
The
governor
could
n't
make
it
,
so
the
lieutenant
governor
welcomed
the
special
guests
.
A
buffet
breakfast
was
held
in
the
museum
,
where
food
and
drinks
are
banned
to
everyday
visitors
.
Then
,
in
the
guests
'
honor
,
the
speedway
hauled
out
four
drivers
,
crews
and
even
the
official
Indianapolis
500
announcer
for
a
10-lap
exhibition
race
.
After
the
race
,
Fortune
500
executives
drooled
like
schoolboys
over
the
cars
and
drivers
.
No
dummies
,
the
drivers
pointed
out
they
still
had
space
on
their
machines
for
another
sponsor
's
name
or
two
.
Back
downtown
,
the
execs
squeezed
in
a
few
meetings
at
the
hotel
before
boarding
the
buses
again
.
This
time
,
it
was
for
dinner
and
dancing
--
a
block
away
.
Under
the
stars
and
moons
of
the
renovated
Indiana
Roof
ballroom
,
nine
of
the
hottest
chefs
in
town
fed
them
Indiana
duckling
mousseline
,
lobster
consomme
,
veal
mignon
and
chocolate
terrine
with
a
raspberry
sauce
.
Knowing
a
tasty
--
and
free
--
meal
when
they
eat
one
,
the
executives
gave
the
chefs
a
standing
ovation
.
More
than
a
few
CEOs
say
the
red-carpet
treatment
tempts
them
to
return
to
a
heartland
city
for
future
meetings
.
But
for
now
,
they
're
looking
forward
to
their
winter
meeting
--
Boca
in
February
.
South
Korea
registered
a
trade
deficit
of
$
101
million
in
October
,
reflecting
the
country
's
economic
sluggishness
,
according
to
government
figures
released
Wednesday
.
Preliminary
tallies
by
the
Trade
and
Industry
Ministry
showed
another
trade
deficit
in
October
,
the
fifth
monthly
setback
this
year
,
casting
a
cloud
on
South
Korea
's
export-oriented
economy
.
Exports
in
October
stood
at
$
5.29
billion
,
a
mere
0.7
%
increase
from
a
year
earlier
,
while
imports
increased
sharply
to
$
5.39
billion
,
up
20
%
from
last
October
.
South
Korea
's
economic
boom
,
which
began
in
1986
,
stopped
this
year
because
of
prolonged
labor
disputes
,
trade
conflicts
and
sluggish
exports
.
Government
officials
said
exports
at
the
end
of
the
year
would
remain
under
a
government
target
of
$
68
billion
.
Despite
the
gloomy
forecast
,
South
Korea
has
recorded
a
surplus
of
$
71
million
so
far
this
year
.
From
January
to
October
,
the
nation
's
exports
increased
4
%
from
the
same
period
last
year
to
$
50.45
billion
.
$
70
billion
is
estimated
to
be
tied
up
.
