              2006 Conference on Non-Empirical Methods
           in Natural Language Processing (NEMNLP 2006) 

                        CALL FOR PAPERS

SIGNEM, the Association for Computational Linguistics' special interest group
on non-empirical methods in natural language processing, invites submissions
to NEMNLP 2006.  The conference will be held on July 6-7, 2006, preceding the
44th meeting of the ACL (ACL 2006).

We are interested in papers from academia, government, and industry on all areas
of traditional interest to the SIGNEM community and aligned fields, including
but not limited to

- machine translation and multilinguality -- a priori grounds for the 
impossibility of translation (including human translation); extensions to 
Chinese room experiments (Tamil room, etc.)

- tagging -- better abbreviations for part-of-speech tags (e.g., DET vs. DT); 
non-empirical methodologies for deciding when to stop pounding on this problem

- question answering -- "deep" questions not answerable by people; new results
in pin-balanced angel counting

- word sense disambiguation -- meanings of words referring to non-existing 
entities ("unicorn", "rationalism", etc.)

As a special focus to the conference, we encourage submissions on the theme

	"From Limited Data to No Data"

Following the last decade in natural language processing research, it has become
clear that simple methods applied to vast data sets can yield good results.  
Moreover, new computational linguistic techniques can now extract applicable
knowledge from limited text resources (e.g., for "low-density" languages).
While these results are interesting, it is clear that most circumstances require
pure non-empirical methods for researchers to make any progress at all.  We 
therefore solicit papers that radically deviate from current practice, such as
but not limited to

- languages that are no longer spoken, for which no written or cultural records
remain (so-called "no density" languages)

- study of text genres with zero-count publications

- hypothesized dialect/ideolect variation in vow-of-silence communities

- applications of non-empirical techniques that have proven valuable in other,
non-NLP fields (astrology, phrenology, etc.)

While it is tempting to approach some no-data problems with empirical methods,
we stress that such papers stick to the practice of non-empirical methodologies,
positing self-evident propositions while avoiding the use of graphs and tables.

                              -----------
                              Submissions
                              -----------

Requirements.  Submissions must describe original, completed, unpublished work,
and include no concrete evaluation results. Papers being submitted to other
meetings must provide this information (see submission format); simultaneous
submission to EMNLP is not allowed due to non-overlapping scopes of interest.

Format.  Submissions must be hardcopy only and consist of full papers of not 
more than 320,000 words (exclusive of references).  Authors are strongly 
encouraged to use the Adobe purple mimeograph fonts when possible.

Reviewing will be blind to author-identity and reason.  No information
identifying the authors should be in the paper.  Please send a single hardcopy
of the paper to:
