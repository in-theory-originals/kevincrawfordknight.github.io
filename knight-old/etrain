treaty represents a major step forward in us efforts to strengthen 
cooperation with countries in the region in combating terrorism 
organized crime money laundering and other offenses it is an 
important part of a concerted effort by the department of state and 
the department of justice to modernize the legal tools available for 
the extradition of serious offenders the treaty is designed to be 
selfexecuting and will not require implementing legislation 
article obligates each state to extradite to the other pursuant to 
the provisions of the treaty persons sought by the authorities in the 
requesting state for trial or punishment for extraditable offenses 
article concerns extraditable offenses article defines an offense 
as extraditable if the conduct on which the offense is based is 
punishable under the laws in both states by deprivation of liberty 
for a period of one year or more or by a more severe penalty use of a 
pure dual criminality clause rather than categories of offenses 
listed in the treaty plus other offenses that are listed in relevant 
uk extradition law and are considered felonies under us law as in the 
extradition treaty obviates the need to renegotiate or supplement 
the treaty as additional offenses become punishable under the laws in 
both states under the extradition treaty extradition is to be 
granted if the offense is defined as extraditable under uk law and as 
a felony under us law in addition to the requirement that the offense 
be punishable by imprisonment or other form of detention for more 
than one year or by the death penalty article further defines an 
extraditable offense as including an attempt or a conspiracy to 
commit participation in the commission of aiding or abetting 
counseling or procuring the commission of or being an accessory 
before or after the fact to any offense described in paragraph of 
article additional flexibility is provided by article which 
provides that an offense shall be an extraditable offense a whether 
or not the laws in the requesting and requested states place the 
offense within the same category of offenses or describe the offense 
by the same terminology or b whether or not the offense is one for 
which united states federal law requires the showing of such matters 
as interstate transportation or use of the mails or of other 
facilities affecting interstate or foreign commerce such matters 
being jurisdictional only with regard to offenses committed 
outside the territory of the requesting state article provides that 
extradition shall be granted in accordance with the provisions of the 
treaty if the laws in the requested state provide for the punishment 
of such conduct committed outside its territory in similar 
circumstances if the laws in the requested state do not provide for 
the punishment of such conduct committed outside of its territory in 
similar circumstances the executive authority of the requested state 
in its discretion may grant extradition provided that all other 
requirements of the treaty are met finally article provides that 
if extradition is granted for an extraditable offense it may also be 
granted for any other offense specified in the request if the latter 
offense is punishable by less than one years deprivation of liberty 
provided that all other requirements for extradition are met 
article provides that extradition shall not be refused based on the 
nationality of the person sought article sets forth bases for the 
denial of extradition as is customary in extradition treaties

offense for which extradition is requested constitutes a political 
offense article specifies seven categories of offenses that shall 
not be considered to be political offenses a an offense for which 
both parties have the obligation pursuant to a multilateral 
international agreement to extradite the person sought or to submit 
the case to their competent authorities for decision as to

attempt or a conspiracy to commit participation in the commission of 
aiding or abetting counseling or procuring the commission of or being 
an accessory before or after the fact to any of the foregoing 
offenses article requires that notwithstanding the terms of 
paragraph extradition shall not be granted if the competent 
authority of the requested state determines that the request is 
politically motivated in the united states the executive branch is 
the competent authority for the purposes of the article under the 
supplementary treaty the judicial branch has the authority to 
consider whether an extradition request is motivated by a desire to 
punish the person sought on account of race religion nationality or 
political opinions or if the person sought would be subject to unfair 
treatment in uk courts or prisons after extradition like all other 
modern extradition treaties the new treaty grants the executive 
branch rather than the judiciary the authority to determine whether a 
request is politically motivated article provides that the 
competent authority of the requested state may also refuse 
extradition for offenses under military law that are not offenses 
under ordinary criminal law eg desertion in the united states the

those acts or c are still investigating the person sought for the 
same acts for which extradition is sought article provides that 
the decision by the requested state whether to grant the request for 
extradition shall be made without regard to any statute of 
limitations in either state article concerns capital punishment 
under article when an offense for which extradition is sought is 
punishable by death under the laws in the requesting state but not 
under the laws in the requested state the executive authority in the 
requested state may refuse extradition unless the requesting state 
provides an assurance that the death penalty will not be imposed or 
if imposed will not be carried out the united states has agreed to 
similar formulations in other modern extradition treaties eg those 
with france poland argentina the republic of korea india and peru

are required to support a request for extradition all requests for 
extradition shall be submitted through the diplomatic channel among 
other requirements article provides that a request for the

competent authority b a copy of the charging document if any and c 
for requests to the united states such information as would provide a 
reasonable basis to believe that the person sought committed the 
offense for which extradition is sought the treaty will not change 
the evidentiary burden required for extradition requests to the 
united states but the treatys entry into force will allow the united 
states to take advantage of the united kingdom extradition act of

act the evidentiary requirements for extradition from the united 
kingdom are lowered from a prima facie standard to evidence

supporting documents required by article within sixty days from the

offense for which the executive authority of the requested state 
waives the rule of specialty and thereby consents to the persons

continues the protection implicit in the current treaty against

for such surrender as being inconsistent with article of the rome 
statute under article these restrictions shall not prevent the 
detention trial or punishment of an extradited person or the
