about DiDi.
<br><br>

<b>Where is the new DiDi Los Angeles lab?</b>
<br>
We're in Westside Los Angeles, an excellent location convenient to beaches, restaurants, boating, bike paths, and shopping. <a href="didi-la.jpg">Nice view</a> from the office.
<br><br>

<b>What does the lab focus on?</b>
<br>
We focus on large-scale natural language processing problems, including communication between people and machines, and between people and people.
<br><br>

<b>How big is the lab?</b>
<br>
We are starting out with ten folks in 2018.  We're a start-up lab inside a start-up company, so there is plenty of room to innovate.
<br><br>

<b>Is there research?</b>
<br>
Absolutely.  Practical problems are a great inspiration for research.  When we attack big unsolved problems, we naturally churn up important research questions.
<br><br>

<b>Is there development?</b>
<br>
Yes.  Engineering plays a critical part in dissecting and solving hard problems, and we want to build things people use.
<br><br>

<b>Is there interesting data?</b>
<br>
Yes, we have access to millions of dialogs every week, plus plenty of non-linguistic data.  The more people use language to get things done, the more data we collect.
<br><br>

<b>Do I need to know Chinese?</b>
<br>
Absolutely not.  DiDi is expanding globally and operates in countries where people speak Chinese, English, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, and others.  Specialized machine translation makes it possible to visualize data in any language.

<b>How about a new laptop?</b>
<br>
For sure,
