<b>Machine Translation Glossary (Kevin Knight)</b>
<hr>

<p>
<b>Machine Translation</b> - techniques for 
allowing construction workers and architects 
from all over the world to communicate 
better with each other so they can get back 
to work on that really tall tower.

<p>
<b>Artificial Intelligence</b> - plot device used in 
movies like 2001, Terminator, and Matrix.  
Nothing to worry about.

<p>
<b>N-gram</b> - measurement of the weightiness 
of words and phrases.  For example, "and" 
weighs 1 gram, while "mass destruction" 
weighs 2 grams.

<p>
<b>Smoothing</b> - the technical process of 
explaining why the machine's output is not 
perfect, to an observer unfamiliar with 
machine translation.

<p>
<b>Model</b> - a highly simplified, idealized 
version of a real process or object, often 
found in Computational Linguistics journal 
and Vogue.

<p>
<b>Perplexity</b> - the usual result of a drop in 
Bleu score.  See also: <b>It should work</b>.

<p>
<b>Translation Table</b> - currently the fastest known 
computer-science method of filling memory 
space.

<p>
<b>Distortion</b> - what happens when you hold 
an English sentence up to a carnival 
funhouse mirror.

<p>
<b>Sentence Alignment</b> - a manual pastime often 
enjoyed by first-year graduate students while 
eating pizza and watching TV.

<p>
<b>Word Alignment</b> - believed to be the next 
upcoming "hit" or "craze" among first-year
graduate students.

<p>
<b>Decoding</b> - the technical process of 
mechanically converting Arabic "code" text 
into normal English.  By contrast, English-
to-Arabic machine translation requires the 
reverse technical process, known as 
encoding.

<p>
<b>Bleu Score</b> - a device for showing that 
more data helps.

<p>
<b>Test Data</b> - data hastily assembled at the 
end of a project just to make sure everything 
works fine.

<p>
<b>Cognates</b> - related words in different 
languages, such as "Ohio" (English) and 
"Ohayoo" (Japanese).

<p>
<b>It should work</b> - one of two important 
statistical machine translation slogans.  See 
also: <b>But it's just one command</b>.

<p>
<b>Joint probability</b> - probability of obtaining 
a joint (see <b>toke-nization</b>)

<p>
<b>Toke-nization</b> - like, dude, this 
punctuation mark was like floating around, 
all by itself!

<p>
<b>Romanization</b> - the insidious global-
cultural process of forcing French people to 
watch the movie "Gladiator."

<p>
<b>Monotone Translation</b> - a translation that 
carefully preserves the same level of boring-ness 
present in the source text.

<p>
<b>Syntax</b> - a type of branching tree in which 
the fruit is, like, really high up there.

<p>
<b>Semantics</b> - like when she says "that's 
fine" but she really means "that's not fine."  
Beyond the scope of current techniques.

<p>
<b>Corpus</b> - singular of "corpi."  Often used 
in the old Latin phrase <b>habeus corpus 
bilinguis disci</b> ("I have the bilingual corpus 
on CD-ROM")

<p>
<b>Translation Memory</b> - situation in which a 
translation system has already seen the 
source text translated before.  Contrasts with 
translation deja vu, in which system only 
thinks it has seen the source text before.

<p>
<b>Comparable Corpora</b> - two text 
collections that have nothing to do with each 
other.

<p>
<b>But it's just one command</b> - i.e., one 
UNIX command.  Used for example to 
describe how to get complete word-
sequence frequencies for a 10-million word 
text collection.

<p>
<b>Probability</b> - any real number between 
zero and one, inclusive, satisfying all the 
following three propositions: it is less than 
or equal to 1, it is greater than or equal to 0, 
and it is a real number.

<p>
<b>EM Training</b> - a computational technique 
for converting a pile of feathers into 
scrambled eggs, and vice-versa.
